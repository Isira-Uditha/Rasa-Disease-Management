            "description" : "Wilt disease\n\nThe wilt disease is thought to be caused by a virus transmitted by mealybugs (Dysmicoccus brevipes). The mealybugs feed on an infected plant and then move to other plants with the help of ants or wind. Wilt is transmitted when the mealybug feeds on young leaves. The amount of wilt in a field is related to the number of mealybugs present, the length time they feed and the activity of ants.",

            "description" : "Root rot disease\n\nRoot rot is caused by P. cinnamomi only. All leaves show colour changes similar to those caused by heart rot. The outer leaves also become limp and die back from the tips. Once this happens, the root system is dead and plants can easily be pulled from the ground. Fruit from diseased plants are small and unmarketable. Plants can recover if symptoms are recognised early and treated immediately. However, if roots are destroyed right back to the stem, they cannot regenerate.",
